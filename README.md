Put the files that you would upload to a webserver in this folder. InDesign, Illustrator, and Photoshop files do not belong here, nor do original high-resolution images.

The code structure is designed for clarity rather than for browser performance. (Notably, we break CSS out into several files, to help keep code organized.)

This project includes elements from HTML5 Boilerplate (see css/vendor/h5bp_README.md for more).
